## What's in a name?

[Girard Desargues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GÃ©rard_Desargues) (1591-1661), inspired by the advent of perspective painting
in the Renaissance, 
discovered a new and intriguing geometry, which he left unnamed.
Although it vanished almost without a trace soon after his death, it reappeared in the 
early 19th century and by the end of the century became an central pillar of modern mathematics,
at which point its development reached a plateau.

In the course of its development, it has been variously named
projective, synthetic, higher, or simply the new geometry, all names
that mirror the manifold aspects that that this development has revealed.

This website has chosen to focus on yet another name: organic geometry. 
We became aware of this usage in an article from 1870 by the English mathematician [William Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford) (1845-1879), devoted to a proof of a theorem in euclidean geometry using the methods of the new geometry.  At the end Clifford writes:

<blockquote>
</p>I find, however, that the theorem connects itself in a somewhat
interesting way with that general conception of geometrical
facts which regards all the properties of a curve or other
continuous figure as depending upon its order alone, and which
it has become usual to call Synthetic Geometry. I am not 
satisfied with the word, and use it under protest for want of a
better. The thing should be more widely known than it is in
this country; the simplicity and instructiveness of its application
in the present case are my reasons for calling attention
to a matter otherwise unimportant. Those who are of the mind
of Herr Gretschel may substitute for the words "Synthetic
Proof," "Proof by Organic Geometry."</p>

The reference to Herr Gretschel led us to the book "Introduction to organic geometry" (1868) by the German mathematican and polymath [Heinrich Gretschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Friedrich_Gretschel)  (1830-1892). At the beginning he justifies his choice of title:

<blockquote>
Organic geometry has to demonstrate those spatial elementary structures and examine them more closely, through
which diverse connections arise between the various geometric structures, curved lines and surfaces. It then has to show how the latter structures are generated by those elements and at the same time show how the properties of the generating elements are also transferred to the generated structure.
If this is done successfully, then, to use the words of a master, we can find the common root of the manifold peculiarities of spatial structures, which mathematicians of the past and present have developed in abundance and through the most diverse methods,  and "reveal the organism through which the most diverse phenomena of the spatial world are intertwined".
<p class="small-text"> Heinrich Gretschel, "Organische Geometrie", 1870, p. 1</p>
</blockquote>

The *master* referred to here is the Swiss geometer [Jakob Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Steiner) (1796-1863), a towering figure in the creation of projective geometry. 

Gretschel indicates that he is not the first to use this phrase.
Perhaps he had in mind the treatise "Geometria Organica" (1720) by [Colin MacLaurin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Maclaurin)  (1698-1746),
a ground-breaking work that applied Newtonian methods to study curves of higher order. Rather than thinking of curves as static objects, he considers them as arising from motion of points or lines. MacLaurin can be seen a transitional figure, from the time after Desargues' work had been forgotten and before its rediscovery in the 19th century. In many regards he was a projective geometer without knowing it. For example, the methods that he discovered for generating conics are projective ones, and the theorem that bears his name is a specialization of Pascal's Theorem, and an important theorem of projective geometry in its own right.

From this we see that the use of the name *organic geometry* for projective geometry has a long tradition.  A first aim of this website is to cultivate the  heritage of this geometry by informing and educating the visitor about organic geometry,
its history, development, contents, and current state, through articles, blogs, e-books, interactive demos, videos, and discussion forums. 

The name *organic geometry* also opens a door to the future. Projective geometry, as noted above, reached a plateau of inner development at the end of the 19th century. One of the fascinating properties of mathematics is that its discoveries, once they have ripened within mathematics, often find crucial and surprising applications in the real world. For projective geometry this path to real-world applications has been slow to develop. At the same time, there is a growing disillusionment with modern science and a search for new impulses and ideas, also from within the scientific community.  

The quotes from Gretschel and Steiner above point to the deep connection between organic geometry and the riddle of space -- the space of human experience. To understand this connection fully, one needs first to become acquainted with the principle of duality, a deep symmetry penetrating all organic geometry.  Such an introduction lies outside the scope of this essay. A fundamental question is whether the principle of duality can provide an extended concept of space that includes the current scientific notions within it as one side of a duality. Applied with a sensitive eye to the phenomena, duality may provide a foundation for a new understanding of the qualitative polarities active in living phenomena, transforming the word *organic* from its current status as a idealistic phrase to a practical concept. 

 A beginning in this direction has been made  in the past 100 years through a small but inspired group of research pioneers.  This website also aims to highlight these beginnings and cultivate their further growth.
